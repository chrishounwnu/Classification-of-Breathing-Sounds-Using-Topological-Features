    "This project focuses on classifying breathing sounds into two categories: \"Normal\" (breathing without wheezing) and \"Wheezing\" (breathing with wheezing, typically observed in asthmatic patients). The dataset consists of sound wave recordings organized into two folders: `Normal` and `Wheezing`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main objectives of this project are:\n",
    "1. To preprocess the sound data and assign appropriate labels (`0` for Normal and `1` for Wheezing).\n",
    "2. To split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.\n",
    "3. To adapt feature extraction techniques such as Persistent Entropy and Carlsson Coordinates to the dataset.\n",
    "4. To optimize the model and achieve the best possible accuracy for classifying the breathing sounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project evaluates the model's performance using metrics like accuracy and ROC AUC, emphasizing generalization to unseen data."

    ">The training accuracy and ROC AUC both reach **1.0**, which indicates perfect performance on the training data. However, the validation accuracy of 61% and a ROC AUC of **0.6** suggest a significant gap, pointing towards overfitting. The model performs excellently on the training set but struggles to generalize to unseen data, as reflected by the low performance metrics on the validation set. This imbalance indicates the need for improvements, such as better feature selection, regularization, or model complexity adjustments, to enhance generalization capabilities."

    "\n",
    ">> The ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve above compares the performance of the Random Forest classifier on both the training and validation datasets. The curve illustrates the trade-off between the True Positive Rate (TPR) and the False Positive Rate (FPR) at various threshold settings.\n",
    "\n",
    ">> Train ROC Curve : The model shows perfect performance on the training data, with an AUC of 1.0, which indicates that the model perfectly distinguishes between the two classes on the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    ">> Validation ROC Curve (AUC = {roc_auc_valid:.2f}): The model's performance on the validation dataset is somewhat lower (AUC = 0.61), suggesting that it struggles to generalize well to new, unseen data. This indicates potential overfitting on the training set, where the model learned specific patterns from the training data but failed to perform equally well on the validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In general, a higher AUC value represents better model performance, with values closer to 1.0 signifying a strong model, while values around 0.5 indicate random guessing. \n",
    "The gap in AUC between the training and validation sets suggests the need for further tuning or regularization to improve the model's generalization capabilities."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "> In this project, we successfully adapted the existing notebook to work with a new dataset consisting of normal and wheezing breathing sounds. After preprocessing the data and extracting relevant features, we trained a Random Forest classifier to classify the sounds into two categories: \"Normal\" and \"Wheezing\".\n",
    "> The model achieved perfect accuracy on the training set, but its performance on the validation set (accuracy: 61%, ROC AUC: 0.6) was less impressive. This discrepancy suggests potential overfitting, where the model has learned to perform well on the training data but struggles to generalize to unseen data. The ROC curves further highlighted this, with the training AUC being significantly higher than the validation AUC.\n",
    "> To improve the model's generalization performance, additional steps such as hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, or regularization could be explored. Despite the current challenges, the project demonstrates the basic process of adapting a machine learning pipeline to a new dataset, and provides insight into the difficulties of model generalization in real-world scenarios."
